# Bank Database Management System

## Introduction
The Bank Database Management System is a project designed to meet the needs of a global bank with multiple branches. The project involves developing a relational database system to store and manage data related to branches, departments, employees, customers, and their accounts. The system supports various banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction management. The database also supports management reporting and security features, ensuring that the bank's operational needs are met efficiently and securely.

## Research Objectives
1. Design a comprehensive relational database system for managing the operations of a global bank.
2. Develop the database based on the business requirements gathered from stakeholders.
3. Implement database functionalities, including account creation, transaction processing, and branch management.
4. Provide user and system privileges to ensure secure access to different levels of users such as customers, employees, branch managers, and general managers.
5. Test the system against user and system requirements, ensuring it meets business needs and security standards.

## System Features
- **Branch and Employee Management**: Store and manage data related to branches, departments, and employees, including salaries and job roles.
- **Customer Account Management**: Support the creation and management of customer accounts, including multiple account types (saving, checking, and money market accounts).
- **Transaction Management**: Allow customers to perform transactions like deposits, withdrawals, and view account statements.
- **Reports Generation**: Generate reports for managers, including customer visit details, the most visited branches, and transaction summaries.
- **System Security**: Implement user privileges to control access to sensitive data and functions, ensuring only authorized users can modify or view certain information.

## Technologies Used
- **Database**: MySQL (or any SQL-based database)
- **Programming Language**: SQL for database queries and Java for user interface and system interactions.
- **Tools**: ERD design tools like I/O Draw, UML for system design, and SQL queries for database management.
- **Platform**: Web-based user interface for customer interaction and management portals for employees, managers, and system administrators.

## Conclusion
The Bank Database Management System is a fully functional, secure, and scalable system designed to meet the banking and operational needs of a global bank. Through the use of a robust relational database, the system efficiently handles large datasets related to branches, employees, customers, and transactions. With secure access controls and user-friendly interfaces, the system ensures both operational efficiency and data security. The project demonstrates the effective use of database design principles, ensuring that the system can be extended and maintained for future needs.
